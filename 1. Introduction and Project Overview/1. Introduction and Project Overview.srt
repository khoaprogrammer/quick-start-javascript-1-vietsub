Hi. I'm Susan with Digital-Tutors, and this is Quick Start to JavaScript, Volume 1.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In this course, we'll start learning how to write JavaScript from scratch.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This course assumes no prior experience with JavaScript so we'll start by talking about what we can create

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
with it and also learn the syntax by doing things like creating alerts, doing basic math, and learn some of

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the basic building blocks of JavaScript like strings, numbers, Booleans, variables, and if else statements.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We'll finish up by creating a zombie text adventure game to apply everything we've learned.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So, let's get started in our next lesson by learning what JavaScript does.
