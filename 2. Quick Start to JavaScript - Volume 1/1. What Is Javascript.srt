00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this lesson we'll learn a little bit about the historical context of JavaScript and also take a look at

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
the things we can create using JavaScript as a language. Before we start learning how to use JavaScript,

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
it's important to take a look at what it is and the kinds of things we can create using JavaScript.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So, one of the most

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
confusing things about JavaScript when people are talking about it or learning about it is it sounds

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
very similar to another language called Java. And it actually has nothing to do with Java as a language,

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
although it pulled some inspiration from the structure of the language.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
They actually have nothing to do with each other. It was named JavaScript more as a marketing ploy due to

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
the popularity of Java as a language at the time JavaScript was created, so we kind of get that confusion in

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
that the names are so similar because of that. JavaScript was created in 1995 by Netscape as a language that

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
was native to the browser, so using it for a language to create products and applications that run directly

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
in the browser to replace other languages that had been appropriated to do the same thing, but didn't run as

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
well because they needed plugins, and things of that nature, such as Java was used prior to JavaScript in the

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
browser to create what is called Java applets or little bits of applications that ran in the browser,

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
but they were slower and it also need a plugin to be able to run that language since that wasn't what it was

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
designed for originally. So JavaScript was created to kind of replace that and be that language that was

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
meant specifically to be used on the web. And JavaScript is primarily client side, meaning it doesn't need

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
to run through a server in order for it to work. Compare that to something like PHP or .NET that needed to

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:17,000
run through a server in order for those to be able to work with a website, JavaScript just needs a browser in order to run.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
While it was originally designed as scripting language, it's actually a fully featured language.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If you don't know what a scripting language is, it's basically when a language is used to communicate with an

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
existing application. An example of this would be using JavaScript as a scripting language in a game engine

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:44,000
like Unity 3D versus using it as a fully featured language to develop something like an application from

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
the ground up. So what are some things

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
we can actually create with JavaScript? Well, we can create something as simple as interactions or small

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
enhancements like infinite scrolling. If you don't know what infinite scrolling is, if you've ever used

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
something like Pinterest where you scroll down and it dynamically loads content depending on how far you are

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
down the page, it's continually loading content when you reach the bottom, that's infinite scrolling.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Beyond infinite scrolling and little small enhancements like that, we can create things like parallax

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
effects in the browser, we can create entire games that run in the browser without a plugin, we can do 2D,

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
we can do 3D games, and also JavaScript is starting to be used more and more outside of the browser,

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
which is really interesting. This term has been coined for that called the Internet of Things, and that refers

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
to languages like JavaScript being used in contexts other than what they were originally designed for,

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
things like communicating with robots, creating wearable technology, and things like that, so it's really,

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
really cool. We can do a whole lot of different things using JavaScript.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's also been used to create entire applications from the ground up.

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
An example of this is a YouTube application for PlayStation, it was built with a JavaScript library called AngularJS.

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So let's take a look at some specific examples of things that were created with JavaScript.

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So this is another JavaScript library called parallax.js, which allows you to create parallax effects.

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll just X out this little menu over here so we can take a look at this.

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You can see that as I'm moving we get that kind of parallax effect and I'm using my mouse almost as the camera to kind

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
of manipulate and change the viewport. So, to see what JavaScript's actual role in this web page is,

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
let's take a look at the code that's running this behind the scenes.

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So I'm going to right-click and pull up the developer tools here by pressing Inspect Element.

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm using Firefox, so we're using Firefox's developer tools, and I'm going to start by disabling JavaScript.

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So right here we see the default behavior of our page, and then if I come here into the Settings I can come

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
down here and disable JavaScript and we're going to see a change, so I'm going to click that.

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And, now you can see we don't have JavaScript working so you can see that kind of inner activity that was adding here

49
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
to our page. We still have some basic animations and movement coming in, but this is actually being done

50
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
with CSS. If we come in here and disable our CSS, I'm just going to press these little eyes, which is going

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
to turn that off, we can see just the HTML on our page. We can see we have images, we have basic content here,

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
but we have no styles and just a very basic inner activity such as the ability to click on links.

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So this is what HTML does is it gives the structure to our page.

54
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:03,000
When we come in here and add CSS back in, we have the presentational aspects of that page being styled with CSS.

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So this kind of sets the look and feel and we can start to do more and more as CSS advances, such as basic animations.

56
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
When we come back in and bring JavaScript back in, we can do a whole lot of different things, very cool things

57
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
such as interacting with our web page. So here you can kind of see the separation of those three languages,

58
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
or technologies, and see how they each have their own role within the web page.

59
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So let's take a look at a couple other examples that were

60
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
created with JavaScript. We have this demo here, Samsung Racer,

61
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
which is an example of 3D in the browser. This was created using a library called Three.js, which allows you to

62
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
create 3D like this here directly in the browser without using a plugin or anything like that, which is really,

63
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
really cool.

64
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Another example that was also built with Three.js is this little guy right here, this is more of a CAD type

65
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
example where someone has created a mockup of an apartment, but we can use our mouse to kind of look around

66
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and control the camera, and in addition to that we can actually use our keys here and move around and take a look as well.

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So you can see a more practical application of 3D in the browser.

68
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You can send this to your client and they could actually walk around your mockup and get a much better feel

69
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
for what you're creating or what you're designing for them, which is also very, very cool.

70
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Another example is with a motion controller. This is called Leap Motion, which is a motion controller that's

71
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
controlled using your hands. You can see he's using his hand in this demo here to manipulate or control the

72
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
scene, kind of move the camera, and in just a second here he is going to start to use his hands to actually

73
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
interact further with this and pull off pieces of the skull. You can use JavaScript to create all of these

74
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
kinds of interactions. So, there are a lot of different things even beyond the browser that we are able to

75
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
do with JavaScript. So, now that we've learned a little bit about the historical context of JavaScript and what it

76
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
does and also taken a look at some examples of what we can create using JavaScript, in our next lesson we're

77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
going to actually get started

78
00:08:29,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and write some JavaScript of our own.
