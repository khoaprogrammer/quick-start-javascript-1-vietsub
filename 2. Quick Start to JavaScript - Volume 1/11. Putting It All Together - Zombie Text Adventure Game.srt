00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In this lesson we'll put everything we've learned so far together to create a simple zombie text adventure game

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Up until this point, we've learned

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
a lot of things so far and we've definitely learned enough to do something fun like create a little text

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
adventure game to help us practice thinking in a new way, because just like I mentioned before, we really are

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
training our brain to think in a new way. So I want to create a little text adventure game called Zombie

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Apocalypse where we chose a weapon to fight the zombie with and we have a 50/50 chance of either defeating

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the zombie or getting bitten and losing the game. So, just like we did with our fizzbuzz game we can start

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
to break this down into parts to make it easier to write our code.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's really easy to try to do everything at once and then get really overwhelmed.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So, the first thing we want to do with our game is we want to kind of set the scenario or set the scene.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, I'm going to use alert to alert on the page what kind of scenario we're encountering here.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So I'm going to say alert, and then we're going to enter a string into our alert, and just to save you the

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
time of watching me type this out I kind have written a little example scenario.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So you can feel free to create your own or you can type in what I've created here.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So I'm going to say, oops and it cut off my it, It is the zombie apocalypse.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You are looting a store and suddenly a zombie bursts through the door, which I'm going to go ahead and shrink

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
this window a little bit so we can see more of our Scratchpad here.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So we have our zombie apocalypse, we're looting a store. So let's go ahead and run our code so far.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So we get a little message and we've done a good job so far of kind of setting the tone.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So we can say OK. And next we want to ask our user to choose a weapon.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So we want to store our weapon choice as a variable so our code can remember what our choice was and we can

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:27,000
refer to it throughout our code. So we can say, var weapon, and then we want to store the results of our response.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So we can use our prompt and then we can insert a little bit more here.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We could just ask what our weapon was, but we want to kind of build on our scenario.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So I wrote something else out here. So, I'm going to copy it and then paste it so you don't have to watch me

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
type all of this. You could say, You search around frantically for a weapon.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What do you choose? And we have a couple of different choices here, we can choose a bow and arrow, an axe,

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
or a rubber chicken. So we want to add our semicolon. And let's go ahead and run this so we can see what

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
we have so far. So we have our beginning scenario. We have a zombie bursting through the door and we have to

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:16,000
search around frantically for a weapon. So we can make our choice, maybe we want to choose rubber chicken,

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and then OK. So now we need to do something with our weapon choice.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So I would like to start by maybe inserting or telling the user what they chose.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So, then we can say, alert You attack the zombie with your, and then we want to add a space here by adding

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
a string with just a space in it, and then we can just use our variable to repeat whatever our user typed in.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So we're going to say You attacked the zombie with your weapon.

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So let's go ahead and test this. We say it's a zombie apocalypse, and let's say axe this time.

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So we can say, You attacked the zombie with your axe. So we already have a really good start.

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We have our scenario, we're asking the user to choose a weapon, and then we're alerting our response.

39
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So now what we want to do is we want to have a 50/50 chance of either defeating the zombie or getting bitten.

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So I'm going to press Enter. And I like to keep my variables all in the same spot, that's a good practice.

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So what we want to do is we want to create a randomNumber once again, so we have our fun math functions coming

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:45,000
back in. So let's say var randomNumber, and then we want to have a 50/50 chance so if we use our randomNumber

43
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
here and we use the rounding to round that randomNumber, then we're either going to get a 0 or a 1.

44
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So we have a 50/50 chance of getting either 0 or a 1. So we want to say, Math.round, so we're going to round

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,000
the result of our randomNumber. So round our randomNumber. And then we don't want to multiply this by

46
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
anything cause either 0 or 1 is fine. So, now we're going to have our scenario.

47
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We're going to be asked for our choice. It's going to attack our zombie with our choice.

48
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And we also have this randomNumber, but we're not doing anything with it.

49
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So this is a perfect opportunity to use our if else statement.

50
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So we want to check and see if our randomNumber is equal to 0, and then we could have one thing happen or we

51
00:05:47,000 --> 00:06:03,000
could say, else if our random number is equal to 1 then we want something else to happen instead.

52
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And we can leave off that else statement and our code is going to run just fine, we just won't have something

53
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
if we happen to get a 2 or a 3 nothing would happen instead. So we can do something a little bit different

54
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,000
here with our else if statement. So if our number is 0 I want us to get bitten and lose.

55
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So if our number is 0, we're going to alert The zombie bites you. You lose!!!.

56
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And then our semicolon. Otherwise, if we get a 1 we can say, alert, then we can say You kill the zombie with

57
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
your, and then we can just reuse our weapon again. So we can say plus and then our space, woops,

58
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:09,000
make sure you use a plus and not our equals sign, and then with our weapon, and then we could say,

59
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You win!, and then our semicolon. And let's go ahead and test our little game.

60
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So I'm going to go ahead and run this. We get our scenario. And we have, oh no, a zombie bursting through the door.

61
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We can choose our weapon, so let's say rubber chicken. So we attack the zombie with our rubber chicken and then

62
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:39,000
we kill the zombie and we win. So we can go ahead and play again and let's see if we can get bitten.

63
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And we win again, but you can see here that we can start to do some really fun things.

64
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We aren't just limited to doing kind of boring exercises like fizzbuzz.

65
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
By slowly breaking this down we can start to build things and increase our complexity.

66
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So in our next lesson I want to go over your volume 1 assignment and learn how we can use everything we've

67
00:08:03,000 --> 00:59:00,000
learned so far to create an adventure game of your own.
