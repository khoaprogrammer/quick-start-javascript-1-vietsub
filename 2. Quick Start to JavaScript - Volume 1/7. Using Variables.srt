00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this lesson we'll learn more about using variables in our code.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In our last lesson we learned how we can create variables,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which is almost like telling our code to remember certain things.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So let's get some more practice using those. Let's say we want to create a variable that stores our favorite movie.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, we remember we can use the var keyword to create our variable.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Then we just need to give it a name like myFavoriteMovie, and then we need to give it a value using the equal sign.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, let's say we want our favorite movie to be troll 2, we can just add that, and then our semicolon.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And now we can use this variable anywhere we want in our code and do just about anything we want with this,

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
which is really, really cool. Let's say we just want to alert our variable.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We can say alert myFavoriteMovie, and then it's just going to look for our variable in our code, look for where

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
we declared it or where we defined it, and then it's just going to pull whatever value we insert in here.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So if we run this, we can see it alerts Troll 2. If we want to do something different with this, let's say we want to log

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
it to our console, we can use this as many times as we want in our code.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So we can say console.log myFavoriteMovie, and now we get it alerting our favorite movie and then we can get it

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
logging to the console as well. So this is really, really cool.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But what if we want to make this a little bit more interesting?

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We can do more than just alert a variable, we can start to build on this in different ways.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's say we want it to alert a full response, well we can just use some of our handy operators to do this.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So I want to add a string to this. Let's say My favorite movie is, then we just need our space,

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and then we're using concatenation, so when we run this we get the response, My favorite movie is Troll 2,

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
whatever our variable is. So this is really, really cool. Well, what if we want our variable to respond to a situation?

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Well, we aren't just limited to setting our variable to a static value like a string or a number or

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Boolean or something like that, we can actually use it to store the response to something that happened.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So I'm going to delete our string here, and let's say we want it to ask us what our favorite movie is.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Well we can just use a prompt, insert our question here, so what is your favorite movie?

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then if we run this, now it's going to look in our variable, it's going to use our prompt, ask us what our

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
favorite movie is, and we can say something like maybe our favorite movie is Gladiator, and press OK.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And then it's going to alert us whatever we inserted into our prompt.

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's going to store that information or that value that we type in our text box here and then it'll use that

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
anywhere we want to in our code, which is really, really, really cool.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So, let's take a look at a different kind of variable. Maybe we want a variable that stores a random number.

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well we can just use var, and then we want to give it a name, so let's say, var randomNumber, and then we can set

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
it equals to. And what if we want our code to generate a random number for us?

34
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Well, there's a special command for that that already does that for us in our code so we don't have to figure

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
out how to write that from scratch, and that's Math.random, which is going to create a random for us.

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So we use a capital M for Math, then we use .random, and then we need some parentheses.

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And it's going to look at this and say okay I need to generate a random number here.

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So if we were to alert our randomNumber, let's take a look at this.

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm going to add our semicolon. If we run this now we get our prompt.

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So we say our favorite movie. It's alerting our favorite movie, and now we're generating a random number as well,

41
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
which is kind of an important note here, this randomNumber command here is going to generate a random decimal

42
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:03,000
between 0 and 1. So if we wanted a random number between 1 and 5 for example, then we can just multiply the result by 5.

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So you can see we can build on our variables in different ways to make them more flexible.

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So if we run this, we get this asking our favorite movie, and then now we have a different number and it's 2.3,

45
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
so we can see now it's going to be not just between 0 and 1, we can get a bigger range here.

46
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So I'm going to go ahead and delete this first part so we don't see that every time.

47
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If we run this again, you can see now we're getting 3.8, we're getting 0.6.

48
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And so this is really intriguing as well. So, now behind the scenes it's creating a random number for us and

49
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
then it's going to tell us that random number so we don't have to do anything here at all, it's just going to

50
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
do all of the hard work for us. So you can see that our variables can be very flexible, we can do very

51
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
interesting things, and we can have our code kind of do that hard work for us.

52
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But what if we wanted to do things based on what kind of response we get or based on a scenario?

53
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well let's take a look at how we can do that in our next lesson when we talk about control flow and how to use

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:59:00,000
if/else statements to run our code under certain conditions.
