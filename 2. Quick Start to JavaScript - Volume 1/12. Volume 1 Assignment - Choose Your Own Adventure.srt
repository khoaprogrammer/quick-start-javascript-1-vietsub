00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In this lesson we'll get our volume 1 assignment so we can apply the skills we've learned so far in this course.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In our last lesson we applied everything we've learned so far in this

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
course to build our own zombie text adventure game. So for your volume 1 assignment I challenge you to not only

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
create an adventure game of your own, but to have fun doing so, and to practice using all of the little pieces

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
of code we've learned how to use, which I've just created this little list to remind you of the different things

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
we've used throughout this course. It's essential to keep on practicing because we really have to retrain

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
our brain to think in a new way when we learn something like JavaScript.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So keep up the good work and have fun creating a game of your own using everything we've learned so far.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I hope you've enjoyed Quick Start to JavaScript, Volume 1, and I'll see you around for Volume 2.
