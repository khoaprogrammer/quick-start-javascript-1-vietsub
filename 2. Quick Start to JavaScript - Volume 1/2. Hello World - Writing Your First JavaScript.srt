1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this lesson, we'll learn how to write our first JavaScript.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Before we get started by writing our first JavaScript, we need a good web browser because we're going to be

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
writing our JavaScript directly in the browser. And we're going to be using Mozilla Firefox so if you don't

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
have that installed you'll want to go ahead and download that and install it.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now, the next thing we want to do is we want to open a file in the browser so we have something to run our

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
JavaScript on, and that needs to be an HTML file. So in our project files, you can see we have just our 03_begin

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
folder and we want to open this index.html file in our Firefox web browser.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So I'm going to go ahead and double-click on this and it's going to pull open our JavaScript page here.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And you can see we just have a pretty bare bones document. We have a heading here, this is an h1 heading,

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and then some basic CSS, which just changes our background color and the color of our text, and also our font

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
as well, so just a very bare bone project page here and we're going to be writing JavaScript on top of this.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What we're going to be using to write JavaScript is the developer tools of Firefox.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So we can right-click, come down here to Inspect Element, and it's going to pull up Firefox's developer tools.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If you have a light background and you want to change it, you can see mine's dark, the only difference I have

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
here is that I'm using a different theme. So if we come over here on the right side and click on this gear icon,

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
then you can come here to our DevTools theme and switch from the light theme, which is what you see by

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
default, to the dark theme if you want it to look like mine. The last thing we need to do in here is come

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
down here and scroll to where it says Available Toolbox Buttons and make sure our Scratchpad button is turned

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
on because this is going to allow us to create a sketchpad or scratchpad that allows us to write little

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
JavaScript files here and apply them directly to our page without having to use an external program.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We can write JavaScript directly in its native environment, which is the browser.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So I'm going to go ahead and click on this little Scratchpad button, it's going to open up our little JavaScript

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Scratchpad so we can write it directly here and then we can see it in the browser on the left.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So I'm going to close our developer tools because we have our Scratchpad open, and now we're ready to go.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Before we start writing this, I also want to save our file so we don't lose any of our progress on accident.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So I'm going to come up here and save our Scratchpad as a JavaScript file.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So we're in our 03_begin folder and I already created two folders here.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We want to always make sure we're organizing our files, so our CSS is in the styles folder, all our styles

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
sheets in a styles folder, and so all of our JavaScript is going to be in a scripts folder.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So I'm going to double-click on this and then we can name it whatever we want as long as it follows that file

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
naming convention for the web. We can't have spaces or crazy characters, we're basically limited to hyphens

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and underscores, or CAML case to separate any words. We're just going to call this main.js and I'm going to

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
hit Enter to save. Now, one thing we want to note before getting started with JavaScript is that the code you

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
write at first is going to be terrible, and this is completely fine, and I mean that in the best way possible,

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and that's only because we can't write good code until we know what that means to actually write good code.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So the most important thing is that you get practice and learn after writing things why there might be a better

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
way and eventually get to the point where you can write awesome code, we just never start out that way.

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So what we're doing here with JavaScript is we're going to be telling the client, or the browser, what we want it

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
to do using a language that it understands. So all we need to do to talk to our browser here is learn that

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
language, which is JavaScript. So, let's start by entering a command here, which is going to communicate with

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
our browser. So I'm going to type alert, which is going to alert the browser of something.

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And then directly after our alert we need some parentheses, so it's going to open and close those

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
parentheses for us. And inside of this we need to add quotation marks so we can add some text in here,

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
otherwise it's going to interpret this as a command rather than some contents.

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So we add those quotation marks, this is what's called a string.

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So you can see our syntax kind of is being hinted here where we're telling it alert, we're going to give it a

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
message, and the format that message is going to be in is a string, which you can see right here.

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So we're going to type in our message. And we're going to tell it Hello World, which is kind of

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
that stereotypical first message that we always write when we're learning a new language, so we can go ahead and

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
follow that stereotype. I almost feel like it's a rule when you're starting a new language and we can go

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
ahead and do that as well. So alert, Hello World in our quotation marks, and then we need to finish this by

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
adding a semicolon. So I'm going to add that semicolon and that's going to tell the browser that this is a

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
statement or a complete command. That's called a statement in JavaScript.

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The last thing we need to do is run our code so it's going to run this JavaScript in our HTML file over here on the left.

55
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So I'm going to come up here and run this, and very, very cool we have this pop-up window right here telling us

56
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the message we alerted, Hello World. So we can press OK. And how cool is it that we can already have some

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
kind of functionality or interactivity on our page? But luckily we aren't limited to just alert, we have other

58
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
commands we can tell the browser as well. So right below this I'm going to use another command here called confirm,

59
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
so that's just confirm. And then in parentheses we have the same syntax here for this command, we're going

60
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
to enter another string or another little bit of text in between here.

61
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So I'm going to type in those quotation marks and confirm that say, I love JavaScript, if I can type here,

62
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
with an exclamation point. And the last thing we need is that semicolon and then we can press Run.

63
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So we have our alert saying, Hello World, we can say OK. We have this confirm, which is almost identical

64
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
to our alert except for we have the ability to press Cancel as well.

65
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So I'm going to press OK and then there we go. So from there you can see that our program is running from

66
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:11,000
top to bottom, it's just going to start, and then read our statements or our commands as we type them in our file here.

67
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If we come in here and add a new one, I'm going to press Enter, and we can use another one called prompt,

68
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
which is pretty similar to these two except for it gives us the ability to type in some text.

69
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So, I'm going to add those quotation marks to enter our string here or our text, and let's say Do you want to

70
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
learn JavaScript, and then I'm going to add our question mark.

71
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We need to add our semicolon there at the end. Very, very important we don't forget that semicolon.

72
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And after I press Run, we're going to see our alert. I'll press OK.

73
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We have our confirm, which is next say, I love JavaScript, OK. And then we have our prompt asking us,

74
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Do you want to learn JavaScript? So we can press Cancel and run away or we can press OK and continue.

75
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So I'll say Yes with a whole bunch of exclamation points because we're super excited.

76
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And then there we go we have our first program. One question you might have is the spacing we have between our commands.

77
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So, the space between each of these statements is going to be ignored.

78
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So if we wanted this all to be on one line without any space, if we run this we're going to get the exact same

79
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
thing here. You can see that nothing at all is different other than it's formatted a little bit differently

80
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
in our file. So the main important thing here is that it's readable for you, it's scannable.

81
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So it's best to start each new statement on a new line like this.

82
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You can even press Enter to add a space between each of these.

83
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's going to run exactly the same. The important thing is if you add a space between this, if you have many

84
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
lines of code, you want to not leave that space between each line because it actually adds to that file size,

85
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
which we don't want, we don't want our code to run more slowly, which in a program that's only a couple of

86
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
lines long like this one it doesn't have that big of an impact, but once we start to have larger file sizes

87
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
that's going to have a huge impact, but other than that it's up to you.

88
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's going to ignore that space between those commands. So now that we know how to setup our JavaScript Scratchpad

89
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and we've also learned a couple of commands for our browser, in our next lesson we're going to learn about

90
00:09:29,000 --> 00:59:00,000
operators and how we can use JavaScript with logic.
